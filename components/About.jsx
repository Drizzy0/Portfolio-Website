          I'm a beginner in web development, learning Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
          I enjoy building projects and improving my skills. In my free time, I
          like to read and explore new technologies. I am passionate about
          creating user-friendly and visually appealing websites and
          applications. My goal is to become a full-stack developer and
          contribute to open-source projects. I am currently working on several
          personal projects to enhance my skills and gain more experience in the
          field. I believe that continuous learning and practice are key to
          becoming a successful developer. Iâ€™m excited to grow, tackle
          challenges, and build things that make a difference!
